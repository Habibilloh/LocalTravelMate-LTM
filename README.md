 This project is made based on some requirements of the tourists who likes to spend most part of their life by traveling. We had a survey from some foreigners and local people about what would be the most difficulties while traveling to some country? And we got several different answers and tried to come up with a bit helpful idea to takle those difficulties. Some people said that they needed to have such mobile app which provides about all informations about the most tourist attractive countries and have functions to book flights, reserve hotels and restaurants, meet local people and get friends through the app before they visit to the country and some of them wanted to post their good memories from their trips and so on. So according to the requirements we made an android application that serve to provide all informations about tourist attractive countries and serve as a kind of social network that has chat function and users post board that all users can communicate through the chat function and can post their good memories on the user post board. 
 I dveloped the Conuntries Info part and Profile Modification that gives opportunity for the user to upload profile picture, set bio and pick username and so on and also I worked mostly on the interface of the App.
Other parts are done by my teamates Farkhodjon and Namowo Kim (Korean Guy).
